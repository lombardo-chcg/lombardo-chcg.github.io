Most of my experience so far with JVM build systems has been with SBT.  I recently started gaining exposure to Gradle and so far, I am a fan.  Here's a few items I learned today

On Mac, `brew install gradle`

* Gradle plugins add their own tasks to a project
* Therefore `gradle tasks` is a useful command on any project

#### General Info
* `project` is the top level object.

* project.task("Hello") == task("Hello") == task "Hello" == task Hello

* `def projectVersion = "2.1.0"` scopes a variable to the build file

* `mustRunAfter` and `shouldRunAfter` ONLY kick in when tasks are triggered from the command line.  In other words, it is not a way to specify a task order in the build file (that is done thru `dependsOn`)

Gradle provides many pre-baked tasks types which can be used in a project by specifying the type of a user-defined task.  For example: `task RunMyTests(type: Test)`.  Other examples:
* [*copy*](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.Copy.html)
* [*PublishToMavenRepository*](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.publish.maven.tasks.PublishToMavenRepository.html)
* [*Test*](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html)

#### Task Lifecycle
* Initialization
* Configuration - executes non-action parts of the task (i.e. `description`)
* Execute - `doFirst`, `doLast`
