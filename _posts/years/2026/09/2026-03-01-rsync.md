Use `rsync` instead of `mv` when you need to move a large amount of data, for example to an external storage device.

Unlike a standard `mv` command, which often leaves you staring at a hanging cursor, `rsync` (especially with the `-v` flag) provides real-time visibility by logging each file as it transfers.

Moving files is just the beginning, however.  `rsync` shines when keeping two directories in sync, with one being the source and one the target.  It quickly resolves delta and thus can be used as a backup tool

AWS has copied this command (in spirit) with `aws s3 sync`, which I use as an easy way to backup local directories to the cloud.

## `rsync` Hello World

```bash
rsync -av ./01/ ./02/
```

This command copies the contents of `01` dir into `02`.  The trailing slash (as with other unix-style commands) means "the contents of" the preceding directory.  `-a` is archive mode, which means "just bring over everything" including sym links, permissions, group settings, etc.


This version does a dry run, and also shows the progress of each file:
```bash
rsync -avP ./01/ ./02/
```
