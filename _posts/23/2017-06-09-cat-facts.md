I discovered the `say` command on Mac OSX today and needless to say I've been having fun with it.

Usage is dead simple:

{% highlight bash %}
say "Hello, this is your terminal speaking"

say -v Whisper --interactive "Hello, this is your terminal speaking"
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a little bash pipeline that recites cat facts:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -s http://catfacts-api.appspot.com/api/facts?number=1 | jq -r ".facts[0]" | say $1 --interactive=white/blue
{% endhighlight %}
