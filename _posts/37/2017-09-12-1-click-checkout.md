Amazon was granted a patent in 1999 for "1-click" purchases.

This patent proved to be so expansive that it was licensed by other tech giants like Apple, instead of fighting it.  Ever purchased a song on iTunes with a single tap?  You just paid a royalty to Amazon via Apple's license agreement.

Well, not anymore.  That patent expired yesterday. ([source](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-patent-on-one-click-payments-to-expire-2017-1))

The [text of the patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US5960411) harkens back to a much earlier time in the history of the web, where client-server interactions and stateful web sessions must have seemed like a strange and new thing (at least to the folks who approve patents).  Its crazy to think that this basic request-response interaction could once have qualified as an invention... I wonder how much Amazon banked off this over the years.
