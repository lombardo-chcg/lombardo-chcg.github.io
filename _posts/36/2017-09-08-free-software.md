Yesterday I had the unique pleasure of seeing [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) give a talk at a local Java Users group.  

One thing I learned during this talk is the difference between his concept of "free software" and that of "open source software."  

By "free", Stallman and his group, the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), mean freedom and not necessarily that the software has no financial cost.  Specifically, "free software" means taking a political and ethical stance: respecting the users' freedom to 0) run, 1) study, 2) distribute and 3) modify/redistribute the software.  Based on Stallman's staunch views of modern technological society, it also means rejecting non-free software such as ["Goober"](https://stallman.org/uber.html), [Google](https://stallman.org/google.html) and the ["Amazon Swindle"](https://stallman.org/amazon.html), which are built upon open source software but do not respect users' 4 essential freedoms.

To me the main difference between free software and open source is that free software requires a political stance about the nature of free computer use, whereas open source is practical, focusing on the benefits of community development.
