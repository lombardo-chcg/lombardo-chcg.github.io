Welcome to the initial post of the blog I am calling `standard in`.

The idea of this blog is to keep track of all the cool software development stuff I learn in 2017.

My goal is to post 5 times per week.  Each post will be a short snippet that represents something I learned that day.

To kick it off, today I learned how to debug bash scripts.  I previously relied on `echo` abuse to print the value of variables as a script ran.  It meant adding, then deleting, many lines of code and carefully avoiding typos.  Now, I know to use one of these techniques instead:

* set the `-x` switch at the top of the file (next to `#!/bin/bash`)
* use `set -x` and `set +x` to turn debugging on and off inside a script
* or just run the script by passing `-x` as an option: `bash -x myscript`
