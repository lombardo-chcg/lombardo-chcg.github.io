`rc` files are common in software development.  Here are some examples:

* `bashrc`
* `babelrc`
* `npmrc`
* `vimrc`

The `rc` file extension has a long lineage, dating back to the 1960s [according to The Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/rc-file.html).  They contain configuration commands for a system or application to be run at start time.  These run commands got shortened to *runcom* and then to *rc* files which we see today.
