So I've been working on this blog project for 6.5 months now, and I thought it would be fun to review some stats!

I'm going to do another post about how to generate these stats using the blog platform that I'm using to generate these posts ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/))

#### total posts
* 118 (not including this one)

#### average post length
* 255 words

#### most common subjects
* [docker](/search?term=docker)
* [bash](/search?term=bash)
* [scala](/search?term=scala)
* [scalatra](/search?term=scalatra)
* [javascript](/search?term=javascript)
* [nginx](/search?term=nginx)
* [postgres](/search?term=postgres)
* [git](/search?term=git)
* [jq](/search?term=jq)
