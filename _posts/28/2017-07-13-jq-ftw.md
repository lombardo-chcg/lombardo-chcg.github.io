excerpt: using curl and jq to clone a bunch of repos from github

Today I came across the need to clone a bunch of git repo's from an organization's page on GitHub.  A perfect chance for my all time favorite fast challenge: a down and dirty bash script!

Here's how to use the GitHub public API to get access to all public repos for an org:

{% highlight bash %}
curl https://api.github.com/orgs/<ORG_NAME>/repos?per_page=100&page=1
{% endhighlight %}

The max pagination size allowed by the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) is 100.  To check and see if you can grab all the results in one shot, we can use the `length` tool from `jq`

I'm using Confluent Inc, the keepers of Apache Kafka. (warning...they have a few large repos)

{% highlight bash %}
curl -s "https://api.github.com/orgs/confluentinc/repos?per_page=100&page=1" | jq 'length'
{% endhighlight %}

At publishing time they have 38 repos so we can grab them all in one shot.  If not just page thru them by altering the URL.

A quick scan of the original response body shows that there is an array of repo JSON objects, and inside each object a `clone_url` field at the top level.  That's what we need to grab.  We can traverse the JSON easily with `jq`   (`-r` to remove the double-quotes)

{% highlight bash %}
curl -s "https://api.github.com/orgs/confluentinc/repos?per_page=100&page=1" | jq -r '.[].clone_url'
{% endhighlight %}

Now we just need to loop over each url and clone it.  We can do that with a quick `read/while` loop

[more on `read/while` in this post](/tools/2017/01/21/jq-and-bash,-part-II.html)

{% highlight bash %}
while read repo; do
  git clone $repo
done < <(curl -s "https://api.github.com/orgs/confluentinc/repos?per_page=100&page=1" | jq -r '.[].clone_url')
{% endhighlight %}


Final note...if you wanted to clone some private repos, you can pass `curl` a `-u` flag with your GitHub username and you will be prompted for your password before the API responds.

{% highlight bash %}
curl -u <YOUR_USER_NAME> -s "https://api.github.com.....
{% endhighlight %}
