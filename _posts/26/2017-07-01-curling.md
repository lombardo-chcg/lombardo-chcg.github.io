Here's a nifty one-liner to get the status code from an HTTP call.

The key is the `-w / --write-out` flag which accepts `http_code` as a valid parameter.  This saves the trouble of a `grep | sed` pipe to get the http code from the standard header output.

{% highlight bash %}
# longform
curl --head --silent --output /dev/null --write-out "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/health

# shortform
curl -Is -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/health
{% endhighlight %}
