The `Either` type is a cool way to handle errors in Scala code.  From the docs:

> Represents a value of one of two possible types (a disjoint union.) Instances of Either are either an instance of Left or Right.

> Convention dictates that Left is used for failure and Right is used for success.

> [http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.9.2/scala/Either.html](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.9.2/scala/Either.html)

To put it in practical terms, and `Either` is (yet another Scala) way to wrap potentially unsafe values.  For example, let's say we have a function that makes an HTTP call, and can therefore travel down a happy path where the call succeeds, or a sad path where the HTTP call fails.  This function making the HTTP call can return an `Either`, and callers of the function would be able to unwrap the value in a safe and predicable way.

Let's refactor our [Failing Gracefully](/languages/2017/06/19/failing-gracefully.html) Scala post which used the `Try` `Success` `Failure` paradigm to use `Either`.

{% highlight scala %}
def fetch(url: String): Either[Throwable, String] = {
  try {
    Right(scala.io.Source.fromURL(url).mkString)
  } catch {
    case e: Throwable => Left(e)
  }
}
val goodURL = "https://lombardo-chcg.github.io/"
val badURL = "https://lombardo-chcg.github.io/INVALID_ENDPOINT"

fetch(goodURL)
// Right(a bunch of html as a string...)

fetch(badURL)

// Left(java.io.FileNotFoundException: https://lombardo-chcg.github.io/INVALID_ENDPOINT)
{% endhighlight %}

This is easy to pattern match against for graceful error handling:
{% highlight scala %}
fetch(badURL) match {
  case Right(someData) => println("SUCCESS")
  case Left(someException) => println("whoops...", someException.getMessage)
}

// (whoops...,https://lombardo-chcg.github.io/INVALID_ENDPOINT)
{% endhighlight %}

It would be easy to have services to handle each case.  The `Left` side could even be a retry policy.

Since we're in Scala land, here's a cool functional-style method we get for free on `Either` types called `fold`.  It does the typical `fold` behavior of returning a single value, but in this case we pass the method a function to handle the left case and the right case, and it does the rest.   
{% highlight scala %}
def handleLeft(exception: Throwable) = println("whoops...", exception.getMessage)
def handleRight(data: String) = println(data)

fetch(badURL).fold(handleLeft, handleRight)
fetch(goodURL).fold(handleLeft, handleRight)
{% endhighlight %}
