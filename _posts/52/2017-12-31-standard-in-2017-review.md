On Jan 1, 2017 I started this site.  My goal was to post 5 times per week, sharing something I learned that day.

It turns out that goal was a little too ambitious.  I wasn't able to reach the 5 times per week standard - some weeks there just wasn't enough time or energy to make it happen.

However I am super proud of what I was able to do.  Also of the fact that after a year, I don't feel burnt out about this process.  I quite like writing posts actually.  I still feel an intense curiosity about this field and I plan to continue posting (tho not at the pace I did in 2017)

Here's a review of where the blog stands after 1 year:

| Total posts (including this one) | 217 |
| Total posts possible | 260  |
| Average posts per week | 4.17 |
| Average post length | 295 words |
| Most frequent subject | `scala` |
| Longest post | [d.i.y. mesos framework part 2](/environment/2017/10/25/diy-mesos-framework-part-2.html) (7671 characters) |
| Shortest post | [silly osx trick](/tools/2017/11/04/silly-osx-trick.html) (269 characters) |
