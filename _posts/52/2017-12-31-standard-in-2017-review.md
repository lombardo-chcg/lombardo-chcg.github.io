On Jan 1, 2017 I started this site.  My goal was to post 5 times per week, sharing something I learned that day.

It turns out that goal was a little too ambitious.  I wasn't able to reach the 5 times per week standard - the end result was 4.17 posts per week.  

However I am super proud of what I was able to do.  Also of the fact that after a year, I don't feel burnt out about this process.  I still feel an intense curiosity about the field and I plan to continue posting (just not at the regular pace I did in 2017).
