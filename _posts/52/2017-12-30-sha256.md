Running the message `abc` thru the [SHA-256 hashing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) results in the following string:

{% highlight bash %}
ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
{% endhighlight %}

So what is this giant string?  What are the components?

Here's what we can quickly observe by a visual scan:
* all characters are hex values: `0-9a-f`
* the total length is 64 characters
* we know that each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits
* the 256 in the name is the size of the resulting hash: `64 * 4`

So we can conclude that this string is just a hex representation of a 256 bit number. How can we get a different look at this number?

We can use the Scala `BigInt` class to view the base 10 and also the raw binary (aka base 2) representation of this hashed value:

{% highlight scala %}
val hash = "ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad"

// base 10
BigInt(hash, 16)
// 84342368487090800366523834928142263660104883695016514377462985829716817089965

// base 2
BigInt(hash, 16).toString(2)
// "1011101001111000000101101011111110001111000000011100111111101010010000010100000101000000110111100101110110101110001000100010001110110000000000110110000110100011100101100001011101111010100111001011010000010000111111110110000111110010000000000001010110101101"
BigInt(hash, 16).toString(2).size
/*
* 256
*/
{% endhighlight %}

How is this number generated?  For that we can use some Java built-in libraries like `MessageDigest`:

> This MessageDigest class provides applications the functionality of a message digest algorithm, such as SHA-1 or SHA-256. Message digests are secure one-way hash functions that take arbitrary-sized data and output a fixed-length hash value.

> [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html)

{% highlight scala %}
import java.security.MessageDigest
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets
val md256 = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")

val message = "abc"
val messageBytes = message.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
val hash = d.digest(messageBytes)
/*
* hash: Array[Byte] = Array(-70, 120, 22, ..., -83)
*/
{% endhighlight %}

So what do we have here?  The output of the SHA-256 algorithm in this instance is an Array of bytes.

`hash.size` is 32, which tells us that each array item represents 8 bits.  

mapping to a hexString, `hash.map(_.toHexString).mkString`, leaves us with something that looks sorta like the official hash that I began the post with, but with a bunch of extra `f` characters.  As a reminder, `f` in hex equals `1111` in binary and `15` in base 10.

This is because there are some "negative" bytes in the array.  Here's a great answer I found on stack overflow to explain what that means:

> byte in Java is a number between âˆ’128 and 127 (unsigned, like every integer in Java)... By anding with 0xff you're forcing it to be a positive int between 0 and 255.

> [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9949856/anding-with-0xff-clarification-needed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9949856/anding-with-0xff-clarification-needed)

So let's map the array again, applying the `and` transformation and also padding an extra `0` char in the case of single digit hex values.

{% highlight scala %}
hash.map(b => {
  val i = Integer.toHexString(0xff & b)
  if (i.size == 1) s"0$i" else i
}).mkString
/*
* ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
*/
{% endhighlight %}

And there's our fully hashed value.
