While working on a mini-project for the home I came across two excellent resources for building a quick UI, so I wanted to give them a quick shout out.

Want to get started with WebSockets?  The "Echo Test" code provided at the bottom of [this page on websocket.org](http://www.websocket.org/echo.html) is a great overview of how to implement a WebSocket client in vanilla JS.  I highly recommended for setting up a local development sandbox.

The [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) project provides a solid foundation on which to build basic data visualizations.  The API and documentation are wonderful - I was able to go from idea to fully realized UI element in about 10 minutes.  Highly recommended.
