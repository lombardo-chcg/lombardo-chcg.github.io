This is week 15 of `standard in` !   So far, I've only missed 3 posts, making this post number 72.

But for the next 2 weeks I will be taking a break.  I'm heading to central Europe to visit Berlin & Prague with my adorable wife Katie, who was born in Germany as an Army brat.

I'm looking forward to unplugging for a while and experiencing some different cultures, some awesome food, and a reinforcement of my belief that there is no "they" in the world, there is only "us".
