[Fing](https://www.fing.io/#fingapp) is a great (and free) app for monitoring traffic on a wifi network.  

I highly suggest grabbing it from the app store and just playing around to see the cool features.  

Try starting a http server on your local computer.  This one liner will do the trick:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000
{% endhighlight %}

Then in the Fing app, find your computer and click `Scan Services`.  You should see it list port 8000 as being open.

You can also check out all the devices on your home network and see if any have a high % of packet loss.  Devices dropping a lot of packets are possible security vulnerabilities in a network.
