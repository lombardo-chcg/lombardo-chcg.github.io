Tagging a commit is a simple way to mark an important point in a project's history.  Tags are commonly used to track releases using the semantic versioning `major.minor.patch`.

Here's a few things to know about tags

#### *1. Tags can be applied to any commit by SHA*

{% highlight bash %}
git tag v1.0.0 94961fb
{% endhighlight %}

#### *2. Tags need to be pushed in order to be shared*
They are not pushed as part of the normal `git push` process for commits
{% highlight bash %}
git push origin --v1.0.0
# or
git push origin --tags
{% endhighlight %}

#### *3. Tags cannot be directly checked out, but new branches can be checked out based on a tag*
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b version-1-redo v1.0.0
{% endhighlight %}
