Just a quick note on the importance of testing.  Today I learned the difference between being confident in feature code, and being confident in well-tested feature code.  There really is no comparison.  Spending time to think of a test plan and execute it is essential to feeling fully confident in application code.  Not only for deployment, but also for maintenance and refactoring.

Today was also my first real exposure to smoke-testing and I am looking forward to learning more about it and writing a post about it in the future.

Also, as you may have noticed, I don't believe in spell-checking nearly as much as I believe in writing tests!
