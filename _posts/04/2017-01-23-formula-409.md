It's easy to make an API, but it is not so easy to make a *good* API.

Using the appropriate http status code in a response is one sign I use to tell if I am dealing with a good API.  It shows attention to detail.

Today I learned a great application of the `409` error code, which indicates a conflict.

From [w3's status code definitions](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html):
{% highlight bash %}
The request could not be completed due to a conflict
with the current state of the resource
{% endhighlight %}

This response would most often be encountered from a PUT endpoint, where there is a problem updating a resource.  But I imagine it would also be appropriate for a POST request to create a resource where there is a naming collision and uniqueness is being enforced.
