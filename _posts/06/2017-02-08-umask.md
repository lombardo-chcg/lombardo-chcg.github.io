Some recent troubleshooting led me to the `umask` setting on a unix-like OS.

{% highlight bash %}
umask
#=> 0022
{% endhighlight %}

In computing, a mask is a type of filter that is applied to an action.

[And as we learned yesterday](https://lombardo-chcg.github.io/environment/2017/02/07/file-system-permissions.html), when a file is created it is set with certain permissions for the owner, group and everyone else.

Combine these two concepts and we get umask: the filter for setting the read, write and execute status for a newly created file.

The `0022` umask status mentioned above is a permissive setting.  It sets read permissions for all three groups and write permissions for the file owner.
{% highlight bash %}
touch 022file.md
#=> -rw-r--r--   022file.md
{% endhighlight %}

Let's change our umask setting and see what happens.

{% highlight bash %}
umask 0077
umask
#=> 0077
touch 077file.md
#=> -rw-------  077file.md
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see it has only set read and write permissions for the file owner.  No one else can even read this file.

*don't forget to change your setting back to the original!  Leaving it on 0077 is restrictive and has real consequences*

The number settings for umask are in the base-8 or octal format.  If you'd like to see your settings in a more human-readable format try this command:

{% highlight bash %}
umask -S
#=> u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
{% endhighlight %}

Tip of the day: if you ever have file permission issues in a CI box, you may want to check the umask settings on that box.
