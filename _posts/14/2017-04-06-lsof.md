Quick post to highlight the bash tool `lsof`, which stands for stands for `list open files`.

It is capable of many things, but one handy use is to find any "file" that is using a specific internet address on your system.

For example, say you started a server in the background and started doing some dev work.  Now you need to quickly find the process and kill it so it can be restarted.

Using the `-i` flag allows us to search only network files, and we can further filter it down with these options:

{% highlight bash %}
[46] # for IPv4 or IPv6
[protocol] TCP
[@hostname|hostaddr]
[:service|port]
{% endhighlight %}

Some examples:

{% highlight bash %}

# to find all processes running on localhost
lsof -i tcp@localhost

# to find a process by port
lsof -i tcp:4000

# combine them
lsof -i tcp@0.0.0.0:4000
{% endhighlight %}

Your system may display processes that are no longer running.  The `-s` flag is available in some versions of bash, and allows us to filter a list of processes by their state.  Possible states include `CLOSED,	IDLE, BOUND, LISTEN, ESTABLISHED`.  An active http server I am running on my system has the state of `LISTEN` and is on port 4000.  let's find that process by port, grab its process id with `awk` (column 2, row 2) and kill it

{% highlight bash %}
lsof -i TCP:4000 -sTCP:LISTEN | awk 'FNR==2 {print $2}' | xargs kill -9
{% endhighlight %}
