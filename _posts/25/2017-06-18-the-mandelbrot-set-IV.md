So I've been recently obsessed with The Mandelbrot Set and its self-reflective beauty so I wanted to gather up some resources that I found to be interesting.  I may add to this over time as well.

### Mini-lectures from Dr. Holly Krieger of MIT and Numberphile

* [Introduction to The Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I)
* [Pi and the Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0vY0CKYhPY)

### Books
* [*The Black Swan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book)) is the modern classic which turned me on to the concept of fractals in the real world

### Wall Art
* [A kickstarter for a vintage style map of the Mandelbrot set](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/billtavis/mandelmap-poster-a-vintage-style-map-of-the-mandel)

### Visual representations
This video is amazing: [Mandelbrot Set extreme HD zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD2XgQOyCCk&t=94s)
and it also includes one of my favorite YouTube comments of all time:
> What if we're just in a lonely arm of arbitrary magnification in a fractal universe?ï»¿

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**: open this video in one browser tab: [Omar-S - Psychotic Photosynthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpuke_gCGcg) - and in another open the Mandelbrot visualization I just mentioned above.  Click play on the music, then switch tabs and start the video.  It's quite an experience.

Side note...Omar-S from Detroit is one of the most talented musicians/producers of the last decade.  Pure, unadulterated soulful electronic tracks that cross the boundaries of house and techno.  I think his ability to draw art from repeating patterns on machines is a perfect parallel to the beauty of the Mandelbrot set's beauty from machines.   For more of his music that goes well with Mandelbrot visuals, try his collabo's with [Luke Hess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqT_HHKPiXw) and [O B Ignitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-c7TPaE_yA).
